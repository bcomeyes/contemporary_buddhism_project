# Contemporary Buddhism AI Project

This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing Buddhist texts and generating academic citations for a paper on the intersection of Buddhist wisdom and AI technologies.

## Project Overview

This project explores potential intersections between Buddhist wisdom traditions and artificial intelligence through what I call the "Dharma Setu" framework. It considers how Buddhist textual wisdom might be represented in high-dimensional vector spaces, drawing on Buddhist Digital Resource Center texts.

The repository includes tools for:
1. Converting PDFs to text for analysis
2. Generating embeddings for semantic search
3. Finding relevant academic citations for specific topics
4. Supporting the development of an academic paper on Buddhism and AI

## Tools Included

### PDF to Text Converter

A Python script that:
- Extracts text from PDF files (including large academic PDFs)
- Uses OCR when necessary for scanned content
- Generates OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- Splits content into appropriate chunks for analysis

### Citation Assistant

A tool that:
- Helps find relevant citations from Buddhist studies literature
- Generates acknowledgment sentences that can be incorporated into academic papers
- Creates properly formatted bibliography entries
- Focuses on addressing specific editorial comments

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for embeddings)
- Anthropic API key (for citation generation)
- Tesseract OCR (for scanned PDFs)
