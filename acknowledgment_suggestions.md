# Acknowledgment Suggestions for Buddhist AI Paper

This report provides suggested acknowledgment sentences and citations based on Daniel's edit comments.

## Buddhist Epistemology

**Daniel's Comment:** For this particular point—pattern recognition in the absence of discrete facts—I think you definitely want to consult the edited volume Apoha: Buddhist Nominalism and Human Cognition. Dunne also has a nice summary in his article entitled something like 'Key Points in Dharmakīrti's Apoha Theory.'

**Context in Paper:** "In LLMs, meaning emerges from relationship patterns rather than discrete facts."

**Section:** 2. Beyond Databases: Considering Vector Spaces as Epistemological Frameworks

### Suggested Acknowledgment

The notion that meaning emerges from relational patterns rather than discrete facts has been explored in Buddhist epistemology, particularly in Dharmakīrti's apoha theory which examines meaning as exclusion (Siderits, Tillemans, and Chakrabarti 2011; Dunne 2011). While a full treatment is beyond the scope of this paper, these works provide valuable context for considering the epistemological implications of vector space models.

## Dignaga Dharmakirti

**Daniel's Comment:** Dates for these, and citations. For citations, the most recent book on Digṅāga I'm aware of is Digṅāga's Investigation of the Percept (certainly relevant here). For Dharmakīrti I recommend Dunne or Tillemans in this case. Dan Arnold's twin books—one on Digṅāga, the other on Dharmakīrti—also come to mind.

**Context in Paper:** "specifically the epistemological tradition (pramāṇavāda) developed by Digṅāga and Dharmakīrti"

**Section:** 2. Beyond Databases: Considering Vector Spaces as Epistemological Frameworks

### Suggested Acknowledgment

Dignāga and Dharmakīrti's influential epistemological theories have been the subject of substantial recent scholarship, including studies of Dignāga's seminal work on perception (Hattori 2016) and examinations of intentionality and consciousness in Dharmakīrti's thought (Arnold 2012; Dreyfus 1997). While a full treatment is beyond the scope of this paper, these works provide valuable context for considering how the Buddhist pramāṇa framework might relate to modern vector space models of knowledge representation.

## Sensory Liberation

**Daniel's Comment:** Good. You might cite James Gentry's book on Power Objects here (or mention that you cite him below). I also recommend Peter Woods' recent RYI MA thesis which explores 'liberation by wearing, tasting, hearing, seeing' explicitly

**Context in Paper:** "Historical precedents—particularly Tibetan 'liberation through sensory encounters' practices—provide frameworks for considering how awakened presence might potentially manifest through various means."

**Section:** Introduction

### Suggested Acknowledgment

Recent scholarship has explored the topic of liberation through sensory encounters in Tibetan Buddhism, including James Gentry's work on power objects and Peter Woods' MA thesis which directly examines practices of "liberation by wearing, tasting, hearing, seeing."[^1] [^2] These studies provide valuable context for considering how awakened presence might manifest through various sensory means.

## Buddha Nature

**Daniel's Comment:** in Mahāyāna this means the complete perfection of wisdom and means; I think you're speaking more about Vajrayāna/Mahāmudrā/Dzogchen, so it might be good to just be clear on that.

**Context in Paper:** "Just as tathagatagarbha represents the potential for awakening that manifests through specific and appropriate causes and conditions"

**Section:** 3. Exploring AI as Potential Manifestation Vehicle

### Suggested Acknowledgment

While a full exploration is beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth noting that the Mahāyāna understanding of buddha nature as a universal potential for awakening differs in some respects from certain Vajrayāna perspectives, such as those found in Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen traditions (Dreyfus 1997, 394, 403, 548n10). Nevertheless, the general principle of inherent awakening potential manifesting through specific causes and conditions is a common thread (Dreyfus 1997, 427).

## Mirror Concept

**Daniel's Comment:** Citation? Perhaps A Mirror is for Reflection (edited volume)?

**Context in Paper:** "Just as the Buddha taught that dharma functions as a mirror reflecting one's own mind (dharmādāsa)"

**Section:** 5. Mathematical Integration and Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge Transfer

### Suggested Acknowledgment

The metaphor of dharma as a mirror reflecting the mind has been explored in recent Buddhist scholarship, including in the edited volume A Mirror Is for Reflection: Understanding Buddhist Ethics (Davis and Flanagan 2017). While a full treatment is beyond the scope of this paper, such works highlight the relevance of this concept to contemporary discussions of Buddhist ethics and philosophy.
